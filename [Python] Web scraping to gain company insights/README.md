# British Airways Review Analysis Extravaganza 🕷️✈️📝

Hello, data enthusiast! Ever wondered what thousands of travelers feel about their airborne journey with British Airways? Well, fasten your seatbelts, because this project takes you on a digital flight through heaps of reviews, sentiments, and topics. And the best part? No need for in-flight snacks or battling with limited legroom!

## Project Overview:

British Airways, being the UK's flag carrier airline, has an overwhelming number of passengers onboard every single day. As you might guess, each passenger comes with their own unique experience, feedback, and of course, opinions. So, we decided to embark on a mission to scrape, analyze, and present these valuable bits of feedback.

## The Flight Route 🌐:

1. **Landing on Skytrax:** Our first destination was the Skytrax website, where tons of BA reviews lay waiting for our prying algorithms.
2. **Baggage Collection (Data, not clothes):** We scraped valuable data points such as reviews, the date the review was posted, verification status of the trip, and routes.
3. **In-flight Entertainment (a.k.a Data Analysis):** We analyzed:
   - **Sentiment of Reviews:** Are passengers feeling the love or venting out their frustrations?
   - **Topic Modelling:** What specific areas do passengers frequently talk about?
   - **Word Clouds:** At a glance, which words are dominating the BA narrative?

Our trusty sidekick, Python, was with us through thick and thin, ensuring smooth data extraction and insightful analysis.

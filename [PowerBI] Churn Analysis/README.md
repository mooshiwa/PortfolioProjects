# Customer Retention Analysis: Power BI Dashboard ðŸ”„

Welcome to this deep-dive into one of the most crucial aspects of the telecom industry: **Customer Retention**. In an industry where acquiring a customer demands significant efforts, retaining them becomes paramount. This project emerged from the vision of the Retention Manager who saw the potential of predictive analytics in changing the way we approach customer retention.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background

With the exponential growth in the telecom sector, ensuring customer loyalty has become a significant challenge. The retention department's current reactive approach, acting post contract termination, needed an overhaul. Excel-based analyses have their limitations, and the need of the hour was a comprehensive, visually intuitive dashboard that could provide insights into customer behaviors, aiding in proactive retention strategies.

## ðŸ’¼ The Task

Our mission was to develop a dashboard that not only reflects key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention but also predicts potential churn, enabling the retention department to act timely.

**Key Performance Indicators Explored:**

- Overall customer retention rate
- Number of customers at risk of termination
- Average tenure of customers before termination
- Patterns leading to termination: call drops, reduced usage, etc.
- Demographics of customers most likely to terminate

... among others.

## ðŸš€ Outcome

This dashboard is a transformative tool, offering:

- Clear visualization of customer behavior patterns
- Proactive insights into potential churn
- A stronger, data-driven strategy for the retention department

## ðŸ“Œ Note

As the telecom landscape evolves, our approach to customer retention must too. This dashboard is a step in the right direction, guiding the telecom in understanding, predicting, and acting upon churn patterns.

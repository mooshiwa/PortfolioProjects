# Telecom Customer Insights: Power BI Dashboard ðŸ“Š

Hello there, data enthusiast! Welcome to this Power BI project focused on unveiling the mysteries of telecom marketing. With the rapid digital transformations around us, diving deep into data is more crucial than ever, and that's precisely what this dashboard aims to achieve.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background

In today's fast-paced world, telecom marketing messages are everywhere. But amidst the cacophony of offers and promises, what do customers genuinely desire? This project, a collaboration with a leading telecom company, was born out of this very question.

Here at PwC, as part of our initiative to usher in a skills revolution, we're not just focusing on digital know-how; we're molding our employees to be "Digital Accelerators." This project stands as a testament to this commitment. As we delve deeper into the world of data visualization, we are one step closer to realizing our dream of a digital future.

## ðŸ’¼ The Task

Our endeavor was to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI that effectively captures the critical KPIs and metrics vital for our telecom client.

**Key Performance Indicators Explored:**

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Total number of calls answered vs. abandoned
- Distribution of calls based on time
- Average speed of answering a call
- Agent's performance quadrant, visualizing average handle time against calls answered

... and much more!

## ðŸš€ Outcome

The resulting dashboard serves as a powerful tool for our client, allowing them to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of their customer base
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in their call handling processes
- Equip their marketing team with actionable insights for more targeted campaigns

## ðŸ“Œ Note

Always remember, data is like a compass in a forest of information. It guides us to insights, decisions, and ultimately, success. This project is just the beginning of our journey. Stay tuned for more!
